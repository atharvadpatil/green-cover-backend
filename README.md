# Green Cover

_This project serves as backend for [Green Cover (green-cover-frontend)](https://github.com/atharvadpatil/green-cover-frontend)._ <br/>
_green-cover is a project that helps in analysing geo-mapped aerial data to estimate green cover and related factors._ <br/>

### Features ###
* Analysis of geo mapped photographs and satellite imagery to estimate green cover over time across the globe.
* Rendering dynamic maps to analyse green cover and generate timelapses representing change in green cover.
* To understand how increasing rate of deforestation is directly related to bad air quality and provide concrete statistics for the same. 
* Time series chart/graph representing change in green cover over the years for the state of Maharashtra.
* Predicting type of landcover in the state of Maharashtra by performing supervised classification using existing datasets. 
* Analysis of air quality on basis of various parameters for the state of Maharashtra.
* A system to manage and sign-up volunteers to arrange green drives and awareness programs.
